# Pothole-Tracker
A mob programmed, full-stack, responsively designed web application intended for the City of Philadelphia to own and operate as well as allow citizens to report potholes. City employees are given administrative permission so they may update reported pothole information such as by scheduling them for inspection and repair, or deleting them from the system. Citizens can view a list of the reported potholes along with a map of their corresponding locations on the main page. Citizens can also create accounts and login as users to report potholes and view more in-depth details about previously reported potholes. The Mapbox API is utilized to render a map along with geolocated markers of the reported potholes. Our team followed an Agile development process to split the work into short sprints, utilized an MVC design pattern for our RESTful API server, and used integration testing through Postman to meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security.

Technologies â€“ Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Mapbox API, Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL
